# NHL Search App

## What It Do

Working with React to create a simple NHL App that draws from the NHL's publicly available API to bring up players, a player's stats, team standings, and team stats.

I really wanted to work more in React, and I've found the best way to learn for myself is to apply my hobbies and passions to it, in this case: Hockey. So I made a simple, easy-to-use and easy-to-view stat finder.

I really wanted to be able to see how teams are doing at a glance, so I made a team stat section, that shows how a team is doing relative to the other 31 NHL teams, using easy to understand color coding, so the user can see at a glance what needs improvement.

With this project, I was able to learn more about React and all the things it can do, mostly getting data from an API and the passing down that data as props in React.
